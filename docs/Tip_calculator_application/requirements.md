# Tip Calculator Application Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

The project involves developing a Tip Calculator application that allows users to calculate tips based on a percentage of the total bill amount. The primary function of the application is to enable users to input the total bill amount and view various tip percentages calculated from this total. The application should then display the calculated tip amounts for the user’s convenience.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Total Bill Input**
   - The application must provide an input field for the user to enter the total bill amount.
   - The input field should accept numerical values, allowing for decimal entries to accommodate cents.

2. **Tip Percentage Options**
   - The application must display a selection of predefined tip percentages (e.g., 10%, 15%, 20%).
   - The user should be able to select one or more of these predefined percentages to calculate the tip.

3. **Tip Calculation**
   - Upon entering the total bill and selecting a tip percentage, the application must calculate the tip amount.
   - The calculated tip should be displayed clearly to the user, indicating the selected percentage and the corresponding tip amount.

4. **Display of Tip Amount**
   - The application must display the calculated tip amount prominently.
   - The user interface should update dynamically to reflect any changes in the bill amount or selected tip percentage.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**
  - The application must perform calculations and display results instantaneously upon user input or selection change.
  
- **Usability**
  - The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate, ensuring that users can quickly and easily input data and view results.

- **Compatibility**
  - The application should be compatible with common web browsers and mobile devices to ensure broad accessibility.

## 4. Dependencies and Constraints

- **Technical Constraints**
  - There are no specific technical constraints mentioned; however, the application should be developed using web-compatible technologies to ensure wide accessibility.

- **Integration Requirements**
  - There are no external integrations or dependencies specified for this project.

- **Limitations**
  - The application is limited to calculating tip amounts based on predefined percentages and does not include additional features such as splitting bills or custom tip percentages unless specified further.
